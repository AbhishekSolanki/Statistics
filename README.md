# 1.Introduction

- _Population_ – Represents all member of a group 
- _Sample_ – Subset of a population 
- _Statistics_ – value derived from sample
- _Parameter_ – values derived from population


- Samples are not necessarily good represent of population.
- The result may not generalize from the sample to the population particularly if the population is not well defined.
- Descriptive stats applied on the sample or population once data is collected.
- Inferential stats refers to the use of sample *to reach some conclusion*.
- one must be very clear about whether the sample accurately represents the population.

###  Sampling
##### Random Sampling: 
- Every member has equal chance of being selected.
- Ramdom selected samples may varies the larger population in important ways, these differences are chance rather than systematic bias in selection process.

##### Representative Sampling: 
- Purposely select cases so that they will match with the larger population on specific characteristics.
- It is costly and time consuming, but clearly generalize the result.

##### Convenience Sampling: 
- Selecting based on proximity, ease of use.
- If convenience sample doesn't differ in ways that influence the outcome of the study, then it is perfectly acceptable method.

###  Variables
- variable - is anything that can be codified and has a single value.
- constant -  has a single score.
- quantitative - continuous variable.
- qualitative - categorical
- nominal - scaled variables in which labels are used to identify different levels and has no weight or numeric value.
- ordinal - variables without weight.
- interval/ratio - contains info for both relative value and distance.


###  Research Design
##### Experimental Design:
- Experimenter divides the cases in sample into different groups.
- easy control of variables, which can lead to bias.
##### Correlation Design:
- not a random sampling 
- collects data based on several variables and then conducts statistical analysis to determine how strongly different variables are related to each other.
- It defines only relation, but can't lead to conclusion.
- It is easier to conduct.
- Easy inclusion of many variables and can examine variables simultaneously.
- Drawback is, it doesn't allow careful control necessary for drawing conclusion.
